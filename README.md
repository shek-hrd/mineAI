# AI Mining Interface

A proof-of-concept web application that demonstrates a novel approach to AI service provision through computational resource sharing. Users contribute processing power via a mining simulation while receiving AI responses.

## Features

- **Fair Trade AI**: Mining simulation runs only while AI is processing requests
- **Adaptive Performance**: Automatically adjusts to user's hardware capabilities
- **Real-time Mining Status**: Live display of hash rate, progress, and shares found
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
- **Hardware Detection**: Automatically detects CPU cores and memory for optimal performance

## How It Works

1. **User Query**: Enter a question or command in the input field
2. **Mining Activation**: Mining simulation starts when AI begins processing
3. **Resource Contribution**: Your device contributes computational power during AI thinking
4. **Response Delivery**: Mining stops when AI response is ready
5. **Fair Exchange**: Processing time is inversely related to mining performance

## Key Concepts

### Fair Trade Principle
- Mining only runs during AI processing time
- No hidden background mining
- Computational contribution directly correlates with AI service quality

### Adaptive Mining
- Automatically detects hardware capabilities
- Adjusts mining intensity for optimal user experience
- Reduces performance when page is not active

### Performance Optimization
- Peak load designed for average consumer hardware
- Responsive slowdown for low-resource devices
- Automatic scaling based on detected specifications

## Technical Implementation

### Mining Simulation
- Uses JavaScript Web Workers for realistic CPU simulation
- Hardware capability detection via Navigator API
- Variable hash rates based on detected cores/memory

### AI Response System
- Contextual responses based on query content
- Processing time calculation based on mining performance
- Realistic delays simulating actual AI computation

### User Experience
- Real-time mining status updates
- Visual progress indicators
- Smooth start/stop mining transitions
